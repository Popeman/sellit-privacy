      <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
    <p class="updated">Last updated: February 27, 2026</p>p>
  
    <p>Sell It ("we", "our", or "the app") is committed to protecting your privacy. This policy explains how we handle your information.</p>
  
    <h2>Information We Collect</h2>
    <p>Sell It stores all your data locally on your device using IndexedDB. This includes item photos, titles, descriptions, prices, and sales records. We do not collect, transmit, or store any personal data on external servers.</p>
  
    <h2>Photos</h2>
    <p>When you take photos using the app, they are stored locally on your device. If you enable the optional AI Smart Photos feature, your photo may be sent to our analysis service to generate item details. No photos are permanently stored on our servers.</p>
  
    <h2>eBay Integration</h2>
    <p>If you choose to connect your eBay account, the app uses eBay's OAuth 2.0 authentication. We do not store your eBay password. The OAuth token is stored securely on your device.</p>
  
    <h2>Feedback</h2>
    <p>If you submit feedback through the app, it is sent via your device's email client. We only receive the content you choose to send.</p>
  
    <h2>Subscriptions</h2>
    <p>Sell It Pro subscriptions are processed through Apple's App Store. We do not have access to your payment information. Subscription management is handled entirely through your Apple ID settings.</p>
  
    <h2>Third-Party Services</h2>
    <p>The app may interact with eBay's API for listing items and Apple's StoreKit for in-app purchases. These services have their own privacy policies.</p>
  
    <h2>Data Retention</h2>
    <p>All app data is stored locally on your device. Deleting the app removes all associated data. We do not retain any copies.</p>
  
    <h2>Children's Privacy</h2>
    <p>Sell It is not directed at children under 13. We do not knowingly collect information from children.</p>
  
    <h2>Changes to This Policy</h2>
    <p>We may update this policy from time to time. Changes will be reflected in the "Last updated" date above.</p>
  
    <h2>Contact</h2>
    <p>If you have questions about this privacy policy, contact us at the feedback section within the app.</p>
